# My Doryoku Log

App made for two sole things: logging finances and timed tasks. My Doryoku Log also means something like My Effort Log.

## Running project in Dev Mode

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
